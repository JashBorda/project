Cristiano Ronaldo did not come from money. He was born in the Sao Pedro parish of Funchal and is the fourth and youngest child of an impoverished Portuguese family. His mother was a cook and his dad was a gardener who struggled with alcoholism and died in 2005 from liver failure. In her book “Mother Courage”, Ronaldo’s mother Dolores Aveiro details how she considered terminating her pregnancy with Ronaldo due to poverty and her husband’s issues with alcohol.You can study the sociology of Cristiano Ronaldo at the University of British Columbia Okanagan
In 2015, BC Okanagan Associate Professor Luis LM Aguiar made the media by announcing his Sociology fourth-year course about Cristiano Ronaldo. The professor believed “Ronaldo’s social and cultural appeal transcends football, making him an interesting study”. He told UBC News, “I’m interested in how Ronaldo has been used to construct several discourses about who he is, what makes him distinct as a footballer, what is his relationship to Portugal, Madeira, and his Portuguese identity”. The course addresses issues of identity, nationality, and representation, and discusses the phenomenon of Ronaldo across the Portuguese diaspora.</p>
